## Challenges Faced
- No finetuning available for chat-bison model
- It was our first time using & configuring GCP & Gitlab
- No Direct support of CI/CD of Gitlab on Cloud Run
- Didn't get access to Google TTS & STT due to Quota Limit
- The TTS generation & lipsyncing had a lot of latency

## Future Scope 
- MedPaLM integration for better accuracy.
- Using 3D model for other usecases like kids' trainer, lifestyle expert etc.
- Break the sentences according to fullstops & punctuations before processing further (to avoid latency)
- Can extend the concept to Metaverse domain
